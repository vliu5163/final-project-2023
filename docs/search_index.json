[["index.html", "Final Project Proposal Chapter 1 Proposal", " Final Project Proposal Vivian Liu 2023-04-23 Chapter 1 Proposal The data: 2021 Yellow Taxi Trip Data (30M rows) The modeling goal: Iâ€™d like to use different column values (borough, time of day, weekend vs not weekend, payment type) to predict whether or not the rider gives the driver a tip. Since tip amount is a continuous variable, instead I could categorize this variable as more or less than 15% tip (compared with the fare amount). The methods or models you intend to use (at least three): I intend to use linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest. For k-nearest neighbors, I will probably use a variety of distance metrics between different rides, including cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and Minkowski distance. For linear regression, I am curious to know which column will have the greatest effect on tip amount. I will regress against single variables, combinations of variables, and all variables to see which column explains the most variance in the results. Finally, I would like to use random forest for classification to classify trips as more or less than 15% tip. Shapley value Use random forest to predict the amount of tip, given calendar and borough information Shapley is a permutation method, looks at all combinations of features (costly in terms of computation) Fit linear model for SHAP by minimizing the loss function "],["sources.html", "Chapter 2 Sources", " Chapter 2 Sources https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nyc-taxi-zones https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hydroTSM/index.html "],["model-1.html", "Chapter 3 [Model 1]", " Chapter 3 [Model 1] taxi_data &lt;- read.csv(&#39;~/Desktop/2021_taxi_data_mod.csv&#39;) Split into test and train: set.seed(5293) n &lt;- nrow(taxi_data) train &lt;- sample(n, .8*n) train_dat &lt;- taxi_data[train, ] head(train_dat) ## X.1 X VendorID tpep_pickup_datetime tpep_dropoff_datetime ## 2885 2909 12405440 2 07/03/2021 07:28:51 PM 07/03/2021 07:37:38 PM ## 10 10 7142653 2 05/05/2021 11:30:48 AM 05/05/2021 11:50:01 AM ## 3208 3234 18732634 2 09/11/2021 07:30:46 PM 09/11/2021 07:46:37 PM ## 3649 3678 29380007 2 12/15/2021 07:52:46 AM 12/15/2021 08:16:21 AM ## 4464 4502 25171931 2 11/09/2021 02:29:21 PM 11/09/2021 03:03:43 PM ## 735 741 25126790 2 11/09/2021 06:40:41 AM 11/09/2021 06:48:09 AM ## passenger_count trip_distance RatecodeID store_and_fwd_flag PULocationID ## 2885 1 0.00 1 N 231 ## 10 1 2.38 1 N 236 ## 3208 2 1.57 1 N 231 ## 3649 1 2.58 1 N 162 ## 4464 1 3.64 1 N 163 ## 735 1 1.85 1 N 239 ## DOLocationID payment_type fare_amount extra mta_tax tip_amount ## 2885 246 1 6.5 0 0.5 1.47 ## 10 164 1 13.5 0 0.5 5.04 ## 3208 79 1 11.0 0 0.5 2.86 ## 3649 239 1 15.5 0 0.5 2.82 ## 4464 163 1 22.0 0 0.5 25.30 ## 735 230 1 8.0 0 0.5 2.00 ## tolls_amount improvement_surcharge total_amount congestion_surcharge ## 2885 0 0.3 11.27 2.5 ## 10 0 0.3 21.84 2.5 ## 3208 0 0.3 17.16 2.5 ## 3649 0 0.3 21.62 2.5 ## 4464 0 0.3 50.60 2.5 ## 735 0 0.3 13.30 2.5 ## tipped tip pickup dropoff duration season ## 2885 1 1 2021-07-03 19:28:51 2021-07-03 19:37:38 8.783333 summer ## 10 1 1 2021-05-05 11:30:48 2021-05-05 11:50:01 19.216667 spring ## 3208 1 1 2021-09-11 19:30:46 2021-09-11 19:46:37 15.850000 autumm ## 3649 1 1 2021-12-15 07:52:46 2021-12-15 08:16:21 23.583333 winter ## 4464 1 1 2021-11-09 14:29:21 2021-11-09 15:03:43 34.366667 autumm ## 735 1 1 2021-11-09 06:40:41 2021-11-09 06:48:09 7.466667 autumm ## pickup_borough dropoff_borough ## 2885 Manhattan Manhattan ## 10 Manhattan Manhattan ## 3208 Manhattan Manhattan ## 3649 Manhattan Manhattan ## 4464 Manhattan Manhattan ## 735 Manhattan Manhattan library(rpart) library(rpart.plot) mod1 &lt;- rpart(tip ~ pickup_borough + dropoff_borough, data = train_dat, method=&quot;class&quot;, control=rpart.control(cp=0)) rpart.plot(mod1, main = &quot;tip&quot;, under=TRUE) "],["model-2.html", "Chapter 4 [Model 2]", " Chapter 4 [Model 2] "],["model-3.html", "Chapter 5 [Model 3]", " Chapter 5 [Model 3] "],["reflections.html", "Chapter 6 Reflections", " Chapter 6 Reflections "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
